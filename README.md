# IE360 - Time Series Forecasting of Solar Energy Production using ARIMAX
This project builds a forecasting model for hourly solar energy production using a combination of time series analysis and weather-based regression, with a strong focus on the ARIMAX (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables) modeling approach.

ðŸ“Œ Objective
To forecast next-day hourly solar production using:
- Past solar production
- Weather forecasts
- Temporal and calendar-based patterns
- Advanced time series modeling with ARIMAX
